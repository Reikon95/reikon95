### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm primarily a Javascript developer who enjoys writing code to provide great user experience at scale. I'm a big fan of both React and Angular, and use both day to day.

I'm looking to get more involved in the open source community, so if I can help with anything, please reach out!
