### Hi there 👋

I'm primarily a Javascript/Typescript developer who enjoys writing code to provide great user experience at scale. 

I used to be a technical recruiter so if you need career advice just give me a shout.

I'm looking to get more involved in the open source community, so if I can help with anything, please reach out!

- 🌍 I live in ...

Edinburgh, Scotland. Absolutely love this country and I am passionate about promoting the tech scene here.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

A proof of concept React Native app. More to be revealed...

I'm also building a youtube channel for technical career advice. There's loads of resources out there for technical help, but not much for careers. I figured considering my previous career, I'd be in a pretty unique place to help.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

React Native, NodeJS, Devops and CI/CD Proccesses.

- ⚡ Fun fact: ...

I haven't missed a Scotland rugby match in ten years, including getting up at 3am to watch us lose to Fiji and having to use holiday to watch morning
games during the Japan world cup. If you don't know much about rugby, just know that watching Scotland teaches... perseverance.
