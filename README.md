### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm primarily a Javascript/Typescript developer who enjoys writing code to provide great user experience at scale. I'm a big fan of both React and Angular, and use both day to day. I used to be a technical recruiter so if you need career advice just give me a shout.

I'm looking to get more involved in the open source community, so if I can help with anything, please reach out!

A new marketing platform to harness the power of a focused niche audience. I'm building it with Typescript (React and NodeJS), AWS and a dash of Python.

I haven't missed a Scotland rugby match in ten years, including getting up at 3am to watch us lose to Fiji and having to use holiday to watch morning
